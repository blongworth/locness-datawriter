# Railway Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway from GitHub Repository

### **Prerequisites**
- GitHub account with your repository
- Railway account (free tier available)
- AWS credentials
- Google service account credentials

---

## **Step 1: Prepare Your Repository**

### **1.1 Push to GitHub**
```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: LocNess Data Writer"

# Add your GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/locness-datawriter.git
git push -u origin main
```

### **1.2 Repository Structure** âœ…
Your repository is already properly configured:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                 # Main application
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml         # Dependencies (uv)
â”œâ”€â”€ railway.json           # Railway configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile              # Process definition
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example          # Environment template
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Documentation
```

## **Step 2: Railway Deployment**

### **2.1 Connect GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose your `locness-datawriter` repository
5. Railway will automatically detect your `railway.json` configuration

### **2.2 Railway Configuration** âœ…
Your `railway.json` is optimized for deployment:
```json
{
  "nixpacks": {
    "providers": ["python"],
    "pythonVersion": "3.13"
  },
  "build": {
    "commands": ["python -m pip install --upgrade pip uv", "uv sync"]
  },
  "start": {
    "cmd": "python main.py"
  }
}
```

---

## **Step 3: Environment Variables**

### **3.1 Set Environment Variables in Railway**
In your Railway project dashboard, go to **Variables** tab and add:

#### **AWS Configuration**
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAWTUM7P4BFXZEZ5XS
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=locness-underway-summary
```

#### **Google Drive Configuration**
```bash
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=./credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHARED_DRIVE_ID=0AFs5PfAkPTgyUk9PVA
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=13dsw95kKIVZo4dmtF6TVoomnYStsl7-2
```

#### **CSV Configuration**
```bash
CSV_NAME_PREFIX=locness_data
PORT=8080
```

### **3.2 Google Service Account Credentials**
Since `credentials.json` is gitignored, you have two options:

#### **Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
1. Add this variable in Railway:
```bash
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"locness-data-464911",...}
```

2. Modify your code to use the environment variable:
```python
# In main.py, update the _get_drive_service method
if os.getenv('GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON'):
    import json
    creds_data = json.loads(os.getenv('GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON'))
    creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_service_account_info(creds_data, scopes=SCOPES)
else:
    # Fallback to file-based credentials
    creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_service_account_file(
        self.credentials_file, scopes=SCOPES
    )
```

#### **Option B: Railway Volume (Alternative)**
1. Upload `credentials.json` to Railway using their file upload feature
2. Mount it as a volume in your service

## **Step 4: Deploy & Monitor**

### **4.1 Automatic Deployment**
- Railway will automatically build and deploy when you push to GitHub
- Build logs are available in the Railway dashboard
- The app will restart automatically on successful deployment

### **4.2 Monitor Deployment**
```bash
# Check deployment logs in Railway dashboard
# Monitor application health
# View real-time logs for debugging
```

### **4.3 Custom Domain (Optional)**
1. In Railway dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **Domains**
2. Add your custom domain or use the provided Railway domain
3. Configure DNS settings as shown

---

## **Step 5: Production Optimizations**

### **5.1 Environment-Specific Settings**
Add these Railway-specific variables:
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
RAILWAY_STATIC_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

### **5.2 Health Check Endpoint**
Your `health.py` provides a health check endpoint:
```python
# Available at: https://your-app.railway.app/health
# Returns: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

### **5.3 Monitoring & Alerts**
Consider adding:
- **Railway Metrics**: Built-in CPU/Memory monitoring
- **External Monitoring**: Uptime Robot, Pingdom
- **Log Aggregation**: Railway logs or external service

---

## **Step 6: Continuous Deployment**

### **6.1 GitHub Actions (Optional)**
Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
```yaml
name: Deploy to Railway

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Railway
        run: |
          # Railway automatically deploys on git push
          echo "Deployment triggered by Railway GitHub integration"
```

### **6.2 Branch Protection**
- Enable branch protection on `main`
- Require PR reviews for production changes
- Add status checks for tests

---

## **Deployment Checklist** âœ…

- [ ] Repository pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Railway project created and connected
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Google credentials handled (Option A or B)
- [ ] First deployment successful
- [ ] Application logs show successful startup
- [ ] Data is being written to Google Drive
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds

---

## **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Build Failures**
```bash
# Issue: UV dependency resolution
# Solution: Check pyproject.toml for compatibility

# Issue: Python version mismatch
# Solution: Verify railway.json pythonVersion
```

### **Runtime Errors**
```bash
# Issue: Missing environment variables
# Solution: Double-check Railway Variables tab

# Issue: Google credentials not found
# Solution: Implement GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON option
```

### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# Issue: DynamoDB timeouts
# Solution: Check AWS credentials and region

# Issue: Memory usage
# Solution: Monitor Railway metrics and optimize
```

---

## **Cost Estimation**

### **Railway Pricing**
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month for production apps
- **Pro Plan**: $20/month for teams
- **Resource Limits**: 512MB RAM, 1 vCPU (Hobby)

### **AWS Costs**
- **DynamoDB**: ~$2-5/month for current usage
- **Data Transfer**: Minimal with current volume

### **Total Monthly Cost**: ~$7-10/month

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy**: Follow steps 1-4 above
2. **Monitor**: Watch logs for successful data processing
3. **Scale**: Add GSI to DynamoDB for better performance
4. **Enhance**: Add more monitoring and alerts

Your application is **production-ready** and optimized for Railway deployment! ðŸš€
